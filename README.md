# HackerRank-Bot
This project is a bot that automates the process of solving questions on the HackerRank platform using the Puppeteer library. The bot logs into the website, navigates to the 'Algorithms' section, selects the 'Warmup' subcategory, and solves each question by typing in the pre-written answer from the 'codeObj' module.
